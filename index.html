                I graduated from university 7 years ago and I majored in Biotechnology (molecular biology and genetics). But I've changed my proffessional sphere and now I want to work as front-end developer. I'm very fit for it: I'm an ambitious, creative person who likes to set high goals and achieve them.I like non-standard solutions and interesting challenges. I'm a creative person with logic and structural thinking and that's why I decided to retrain as a front-end developer. I constantly study information and sources Frond-end development related. RSS is my first step into scope of IT development. I want to get additional skills, become an excellent specialist and go up the career ladder.
